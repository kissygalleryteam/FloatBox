        <h4 class="J_FloatTitle">Attention Mining</h4>

        <p>When friends and family ask what my son is into these days, I usually tell them Minecraft. It’s not
            surprising that a 10-year-old would like to play video games, and people have usually heard of Minecraft, so
            there’s usually some nodding of recognition.

            What I don’t tell them is that while he does certainly play Minecraft, he’s also really into watching people
            play Minecraft on YouTube. You tell people without a 10-year-old that and you’ll find there’s less
            recognition and more concerned stares.

            Watching people play a video game? What kind of crappy parenting led your child to this, the laziest of the
            voyeurisms?

            Well, Mike and/or Carol Brady, it might surprise you to know that Minecraft is a game that fosters not only
            creativity but also computer skills. And YouTube Minecraft videos are a way for kids to learn not only how
            to play the game but also how to modify it in almost endless combinations. It also brings them into a
            community of Minecraft players and turns something that can be an individual activity into something social.

            So now who’s the lousy parent?

            Oh, it’s still me? Well, you’re probably not wrong.</p>
        <h4 class="J_FloatTitle">Suitable viewing for miners</h4>

        <p>Regardless of your feelings about these videos, there’s no denying their success. If you’ve been living in a
            cave for the last four years…then you probably already know about Minecraft, the game that’s first-person
            shooter meets Lego. Because there are a lot of caves in the game.

            Like the game itself, Minecraft YouTube videos are fantastically popular, and a core group of producers of
            these videos have enjoyed a wild ride up the virtual charts. Type “diamond” into the YouTube search field
            and the first hit that comes up is “Diamonds Rihanna,” which I guess is a song by the popular recording
            artist, uh, Lady Gaga? I have no idea. I’ve never looked at it because here at my house we always go to the
            second result: “Diamond Minecart.”

            What the heck is a Diamond Minecart? It’s the YouTube channel of 22-year-old Daniel Middleton of
            Northamptonshire, England. Middleton’s channel has almost 1.9 million subscribers, and people have watched
            his videos over 400 million times. Which sounds low because I think my son has watched his videos a million
            times himself.

            Middleton got into Minecraft two years ago and started his channel after running a Pokémon-focused channel
            for three years. That channel amassed what might normally be considered a respectable 10,000 followers, but
            in the world of Minecraft YouTubers, it’s a drop in the wooden chest where you keep all your stuff.

            Middleton’s channel focuses on showcasing Minecraft modifications (mods), which are game patches that
            members of the Minecraft community develop and distribute for free. Mods can change the look and feel of the
            game but mostly provide enhanced features. A Lord of the Rings mod, for example, adds elven forests,
            dwarvish mines, hobbits, orcs, trolls, mithril weapons — everything short of Orlando Bloom’s dreamy stare.
            At any given time there are dozens if not hundreds of these mods being actively developed, giving Middleton
            a decent place to start when looking for material.

            That said, it’s not a simple thing to put together a video every day. Middleton says the process can take
            anywhere from four to eight hours, and he frequently uploads as many as 10 videos a week. And then there’s
            opening all the fan mail.

            Maybe that’s why Minecraft YouTubing is decidedly a game for the young. Charlie Lobsenz of Maryland,
            proprietor of ChazOffTopic, another mod showcase channel, has a more modest 140,000 subscribers and 20
            million views, but at 17 years old, he’s got time to grow the business. That’s assuming he even wants to.

            “Putting money, views, networks, business, and analytics aside, this is all just about having fun and making
            people laugh and entertained. Money is nice and all but if I am not having fun doing it then I will probably
            consider stopping.” Lobsenz is going to college in the fall to major in business.</p>
        <h4 class="J_FloatTitle">King of the mountain</h4>

        <p>The king of the Minecraft-focused YouTubers is arguably 23-year-old Joseph Garrett of Portsmouth, England, a
            former bartender with an infectious laugh who operates under the name Stampy with an avatar of a cat.
            Garrett’s Minecraft channel focuses on “let’s play” Minecraft videos that feature him and some friends
            playing the game on various servers, custom maps, or adventure maps.

            It’s not as simple as hopping into a game, recording your video, and then dumping it onto the Internet,
            though. Garrett has a degree in television and video production and a fairly polished presence. You’ll
            rarely hear an “ummm” out of him, even when he’s being interviewed on BBC television.

            He also has a definitive style. It’s a style that may annoy some parents, but it’s one that matches the
            lighthearted manner of children’s programming. His Facebook page regularly features pictures from children
            who’ve made homages to his Minecraft character out of crayon, clay, cardboard, face paint, and even
            pancakes. A plumber who came to his parent’s house (where he still lives pending a search for a
            house/recording studio to share with a fellow Minecraft YouTuber, iBallisticSquid) asked for an autograph
            for his son.

            Stampy is the favorite host of 7-year-old Alice Cyr of San Mateo, California. “He’s not boring, and he’s
            cheerful,” Alice said. “He made a time machine but it didn’t work. I like to watch him because he doesn’t
            just build and do adventures, and he doesn’t just stay at home. He plays.”

            Despite his popularity with children, Garrett says he didn’t plan it that way. “All of the kids stuff was
            accidental. I never set out to make videos for children. I just made videos for the fun of making videos. As
            soon as I noticed that children were watching I cut out all swearing…not to market toward kids, hoping that
            kids would watch — I just realized kids were watching and I didn’t want to get told off by parents.”

            While the tone is that of a kid’s show, it’s not infantile. I had long overheard my son watching Stampy’s
            videos, but it wasn’t until I sat down and watched one by myself that I realized there’s just something
            compelling about watching other people have fun.

            As Garrett says, “It’s me on like a really good day, when I’ve woken up in the morning and I’m full of
            energy and the world is good. Nothing’s ever bad.” But it’s still all him. “You can’t be putting on a
            character like that. It would drive you crazy.”
        </p>

        <h4 class="J_FloatTitle">Revenue data mining</h4>

        <p>
            It’s easy to see why he’s happy. When I first interviewed Garrett in February he had 1.5 million
            subscribers. Since then he’s passed 2 million, as well as crossed 708 million views. With those kinds of
            numbers, the game is afoot to figure out how much money these video producers make off of this.

            Garrett obviously won’t give details other than to note that an average CPM (cost per thousand views) would
            be $7. The Daily Mail estimates that his channel currently grosses anywhere from $88,000 to $880,000 a
            month. Yes, you read that right.

            Google takes 45 percent of that, and Garrett’s network partner, Polaris — which does Web site creation,
            merchandising, promotion, and requisitioning — takes another cut. But, yes, those at the top of the game do
            quite nicely, thank you very much.

            Farther down the scale, Lobsenz said he often grosses anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 a month, which is a
            lot of gas money for a high school student. Middleton wouldn’t say how much he makes, but like Garrett he
            runs his channel full-time, something he was able to start doing just five months ago.

            “At the start of 2013 I had 1,600 subscribers, and the channel was only a month or so old at the time,”
            Middleton says. He notes that his channel really took off over the summer, when kids had more free time.

            Garrett experienced a similar hockey stick. He notes, “On my older channel it took me about three years to
            get 1,000 subscribers, and then within the last year I went from 1,000 to a million and a half. So it was
            lots of getting a subscriber a day, to the point now where I’m getting anything up to 25,000 subscribers a
            day.”
